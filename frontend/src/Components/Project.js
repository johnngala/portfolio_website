                Oxymusic is a fun project that i build in my spare time.
                I've always frowned upon  how music apps come with  a lot 
                of  unnecessary features,so i decided to build one that i would
                love to use.The project is still a work in progress but 
                coming along very well nonetheless.Find out more from the 
               <a href = "http://www.oxy-music.com"> official website </a> or download the app from <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oxymusic.myaudioplayer">playstore </a>.
